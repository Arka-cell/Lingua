# Lingua

Lingua is a library that used many features to assess readability. One of them is dependency length. Currently, I have developed the basic components of the library to answer a theoretical linguistic hypothesis. I’ll be developing the library, and give more detailed explanations more often after my VIVA. The library still doesn’t have good writing practice and a clear README section.
You can check Lingua Tutorial jupyter notebook to get a grasp on how the library does work.
